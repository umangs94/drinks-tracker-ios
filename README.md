# Drinks Tracker

In 2017, I published an iOS app called Drinks Tracker on the App Store. I created an algorithm that calculates the userâ€™s BAC level based on multiple metrics, which the app used to notify the user about their estimated Blood Alcohol Content (BAC) level. The app was installed by over 3.9k users and got 104k impressions when Apple removed this category of apps from the App Store in 2018.

This project was uploaded to GitHub in 2019.

## Description

Drinks Tracker allows you to search a huge list of nearly 4000 drinks and easily add drinks to track your Blood Alcohol Content (BAC) percentage. 

### Features
* Search and easily add from nearly 4000 drinks
* Easily add custom drinks in a few taps (be sure to suggest them to the developer so that they can be added to the full list!)
* Get notifications when your BAC has reached 0.08% and 0%
* Customize your profile and choose between using the BAC and EBAC formula
